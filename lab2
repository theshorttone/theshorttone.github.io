  <p>I am from <em>California</em> but still love the east coast, mainly the forests here. </p>
  <p>I am really into rock climbing</p>
  <h3>Some random thoughts I had while making this page</h3>
  <p> I really hope that I am making this file correctly. <p/>
  <p> Now I'm noticing that without Grammarly, I would have so many <del>speling erors</del> here. <p/>
