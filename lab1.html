  <h1>About me </h1>
  <h3>Some basic info</h3>
  <p>I am a 25 at Dartmouth College taking Web mapping. <p/>
  <p>I am from California but still love the east coast, mainly the forests here. </p>
  <h3>Some random thoughts I had while making this page</h3>
  <p> I really hope that I am making this file correctly. <p/>
  <p> Now I'm noticing that without Grammarly, I would have so many spelling errors here. <p/>
